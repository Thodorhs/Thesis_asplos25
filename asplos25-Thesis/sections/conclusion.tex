\section{Conclusions}
Big data analytics frameworks on JVMs are widely used in data centers for large dataset analysis. Research has explored extending the managed heap with fast local storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) and remote memory, but comprehensive performance and reliability comparisons are lacking. In our comparative analysis, we first employed micro-benchmarks to explore the latencies of various storage systems, including local NVMe, remote NVMe, and remote memory. We then selectively compared local device systems with NVMe-oF SPDK NVMe using TeraHeap, which extends the managed heap over these devices. We evaluated these options with 13 widely-used applications in two real-world big data frameworks, Spark and Giraph. The workload reports indicate that NVMe-oF and remote options can match the performance of local ones, yielding very similar results. This study provides valuable insights into the performance characteristics of different storage solutions, informing decisions on resource allocation and system design, and contributing to the ongoing discourse on efficient data management in contemporary computing environments.
